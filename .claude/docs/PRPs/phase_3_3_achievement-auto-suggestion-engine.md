# PRP: Achievement Auto-Suggestion Engine (Phase 3.3)

## Overview

Implement a practical achievement auto-suggestion system that analyzes student grade improvement patterns and automatically suggests relevant achievements from the shared achievements database. This system provides teachers with data-driven recommendations for student achievements with confidence indicators to streamline the report card generation workflow.

## Research Context

### Assignment Requirements Analysis
Based on the assignment brief requirements:

- **Core Need**: "Auto‑suggest achievements (pulled from a shared achievements DB) and allow quick inclusion/exclusion"
- **Practical Focus**: Simple, functional system that helps teachers work efficiently
- **No AI Complexity**: Assignment specifically warns against "weird AI junk" and over-abstractions
- **Data-Driven**: Use mathematical analysis of grade patterns to match existing achievement categories

**Key Insight**: The system should be a practical tool that saves teachers time by suggesting relevant achievements from the database based on clear performance patterns.

### Existing Codebase Patterns

**Service Layer Architecture** (`src/app/services/`):
- All services follow dependency injection: `def __init__(self, db: Session)`
- RBAC enforcement through user parameter: `user: User`
- Business logic separation from API endpoints
- Error handling with detailed messages

**API Endpoint Patterns** (`src/app/api/v1/endpoints/`):
- Thin controllers with service delegation
- Consistent dependency injection: `get_current_user`, `get_db`
- Pydantic response models for type safety
- HTTP status code error handling

**Existing Grade Improvement Logic** (`src/app/services/grade_service.py:calculate_improvement`):
```python
def calculate_improvement(self, student_id: int, subject_id: int, user: User) -> Optional[Dict[str, any]]:
    # Already implements improvement percentage calculation
    improvement_percentage = (improvement_amount / float(first_grade.score)) * 100
    return {
        "improvement_percentage": improvement_percentage,
        "total_terms": len(grades),
        # ... other metrics
    }
```

**Achievement Categories with Mathematical Triggers** (`src/app/core/seed_data.py`):
```python
# 15 pre-defined achievement categories with precise trigger conditions:
# - Significant improvement: min_improvement_percent=20.0 (4 subjects)
# - Steady progress: min_improvement_percent=10.0 (4 subjects)  
# - Excellence: min_score=90.0 (4 subjects)
# - Overall improvement: min_improvement_percent=15.0
# - Consistent high performance: min_score=85.0
# - Outstanding effort: behavioral category
```

**Test Data with Known Patterns** (`tests/test_seed_data/test_achievement_triggers.py`):
- Students 0-2: Significant improvement (≥20% all subjects)
- Students 3-5: Steady progress (10-19% improvement)
- Students 6-8: Excellence achievers (≥90 scores)
- Students 9-11: Stable performers (<10% improvement)

## Implementation Blueprint

### 1. Achievement Schemas (`src/app/schemas/achievement_schemas.py`)

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class AchievementSuggestionResponse(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str
    category_name: str
    relevance_score: float = Field(..., ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    explanation: str
    supporting_data: dict
    
class StudentAchievementSuggestionsResponse(BaseModel):
    student_id: int
    term_id: int
    student_name: str
    term_name: str
    suggestions: List[AchievementSuggestionResponse]
    total_suggestions: int
    average_relevance: float
```

### 2. Achievement Service (`src/app/services/achievement_service.py`)

```python
class AchievementService:
    def __init__(self, db: Session):
        self.db = db
        self.grade_service = GradeService(db)
    
    def get_achievement_suggestions(self, student_id: int, term_id: int, user: User) -> Dict:
        # 1. Verify RBAC access using existing patterns
        # 2. Get all subjects and calculate improvements using GradeService
        # 3. Match improvements against AchievementCategory triggers
        # 4. Calculate relevance scores using simple but effective scoring
        # 5. Generate explanations with supporting data
        # 6. Return structured suggestions
        pass
    
    def _calculate_relevance_score(self, improvement_data: Dict, achievement_category: AchievementCategory) -> float:
        # Simple relevance scoring based on:
        # - Achievement threshold met/exceeded
        # - Data quality (number of terms)
        # - Clear, understandable logic
        pass
```

### 3. API Endpoint (`src/app/api/v1/endpoints/achievements.py`)

```python
@router.get("/suggest/{student_id}/{term_id}", response_model=StudentAchievementSuggestionsResponse)
async def suggest_achievements(
    student_id: int,
    term_id: int,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
):
    """
    Get achievement suggestions for a student in a specific term.
    
    Returns suggested achievements from shared database based on grade patterns
    with relevance indicators and supporting data.
    """
    achievement_service = AchievementService(db)
    suggestions = achievement_service.get_achievement_suggestions(student_id, term_id, current_user)
    
    if not suggestions:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
            detail="Student not found or insufficient data for suggestions"
        )
    
    return StudentAchievementSuggestionsResponse(**suggestions)
```

### 4. Suggestion Algorithm Logic

**Relevance Score Calculation** (Simple but effective):
```python
def _calculate_relevance_score(self, improvement_percent: float, threshold: float, data_points: int) -> float:
    # Simple relevance scoring based on how well data matches thresholds
    # Factors: threshold achievement, data quality
    if improvement_percent >= threshold:
        base_score = 0.9  # Strong match
    elif improvement_percent >= threshold * 0.8:
        base_score = 0.7  # Good match
    else:
        base_score = 0.3  # Weak match
    
    # Adjust for data quality (more terms = more reliable)
    reliability_factor = min(data_points / 3.0, 1.0)
    return base_score * reliability_factor
```

**Achievement Matching Strategy**:
1. **Subject-Specific Achievements**: Match improvement per subject against category thresholds
2. **Overall Achievements**: Calculate cross-subject average improvements  
3. **Excellence Achievements**: Check current term scores against excellence thresholds
4. **Relevance Ranking**: Sort by relevance score, return best matches
5. **Teacher Workflow**: Present suggestions with include/exclude interface

### 5. Integration Points

**API Router Integration** (`src/app/api/v1/api.py`):
```python
from app.api.v1.endpoints import achievements
api_router.include_router(achievements.router, prefix="/achievements", tags=["achievements"])
```

**Service Dependencies**:
- **GradeService**: Reuse existing `calculate_improvement` and grade access methods
- **StudentService**: Verify student access permissions 
- **AchievementCategory Model**: Use existing trigger conditions
