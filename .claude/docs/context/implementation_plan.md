# Implementation Plan - Teacher Report Card Assistant

## Overview
MVP implementation plan for multi-tenant report card generation system for Singapore primary schools, focused on delivering the core assignment requirements efficiently.

## Assignment Requirements Alignment
- **Multi-tenant**: 3 schools sharing same system ✅
- **Multi-role**: Teachers see assigned students only, Head teachers see all ✅ 
- **Two core pages**: Dashboard + Report Generation ✅
- **Core functionality**: Grade recording, auto-suggestions, PDF generation ✅
- **Stack**: FastAPI + Next.js + PostgreSQL + Docker Compose ✅
- **Security**: RBAC, input validation, CSRF protection ✅

## Updated Technical Decisions
- **Authentication**: Session-based auth (simpler than JWT)
- **Grade Management**: Teachers can input/edit grades for core subjects
- **Achievement Engine**: Auto-suggest based on grade improvements (≥20%, ≥10%, ≥90)
- **PDF Generation**: Simple HTML-to-PDF (synchronous)
- **UI Components**: Basic responsive forms (focus on functionality over polish)
- **Testing**: Critical paths and security only
- **Data**: 12 students across 3 schools (already seeded)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **PDF Generation Issues**: Start with HTML print view, enhance to PDF
- **Session Management**: Use simple cookie-based sessions (already planned)
- **Frontend Complexity**: Focus on functionality over polish initially
- **Time Constraints**: Prioritize core requirements, skip optional features

### Success Strategy
- **Leverage Phase 1**: Strong foundation already completed
- **Follow established patterns**: Use existing test structure, Docker setup
- **Incremental development**: Get each phase working before moving to next
- **Focus on requirements**: Hit every assignment requirement exactly
- **AI-assisted velocity**: Use Claude Code for rapid development

**This plan delivers 100% of assignment requirements with realistic time estimates.** 🎯
