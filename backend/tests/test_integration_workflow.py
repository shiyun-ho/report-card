"""
Integration tests for end-to-end report generation workflow.

Tests the core assignment requirements:
- Complete workflow: Login → Get Students → Generate Report  
- RBAC: Form teachers vs Year heads access control
- Multi-tenant: Cross-school access prevention
- Edge cases: Non-existent students, invalid data

SECURITY: Uses only environment variables for credentials.
No hardcoded passwords or sensitive data in test files.
